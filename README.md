# Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1)
---

## Project goals

The task is to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker will also be needed to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Run the application
In order to run the application

Access code here:

1. Run it locally by download/cloning repo:

Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
